"""MNG lazy recompute: at SessionStart, compute over the accumulated ledger now → archive inactive symbols, running before this session's recall.

mng.md: a non-resident host has no background sweep, so eviction rides SessionStart — read the sidecar
(calls numerator + anchor) + the layer request counters (denominator) accumulated watermark, run the
lifecycle decision, and move the to-archive list out of the live tree one by one (archiving = moving the
directory out of recall, reversible). The decision reads only accumulated quantities (not what this
session happened to see) → any repo's SessionStart reaches the same conclusion. Once per session, no
throttling. Manages only self-produced symbols (native / user skills stay outside the pool, preserving
zero intrusion).

ponytail: GC of orphan session counts (residue from crashed sessions) needs a session-liveness signal to sweep safely (a naive sweep would wrongly delete a concurrent session's live count), so it is deferred until that signal exists — the clear_session primitive is ready (Phase 4), policy left open in cap.md/mng.md.
